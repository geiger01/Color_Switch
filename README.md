Switch random colors, Lock and copy them.

An app built with css, html and javascript which you can switch random colors by pressing the "Generate" button,
You can lock in colors you liked by clicking the lock symbol, And finally you can copy the colors you liked to the clipboard and paste them wherever you want.

To create all of these features I used a lot of DON manipulation.
